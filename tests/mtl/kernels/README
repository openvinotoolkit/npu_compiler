Build simple single-file test kernels for MTL activation SHAVE. You can use the
makefile to build the kernels included in ./src:

    make <target>
    make all
    make clean

Targets:
    hello
    vau_tanh
    vau_sigm
    vau_exp
    vau_log

For each kernel, we will produce two output files. The ".text" file will
contain the reusable, read-only kernel data located in the 0x1D window, and the
".data" file will contain the argument block and other writable data located in
the 0x1E window:
    output/
        <target>.text
        <target>.data

In addition, for debugging purposes, we will produce assembler output, ELF
executable, and file contents:
    output/
        <target>.asm
        <target>.elf
        <target>_sections.txt
        <target>_symbols.txt
        <target>_relocations.txt

For other test kernels, outside ./src, you may invoke the script directly:

  bash compile.sh <source>

If you want to place output elsewhere, provide a second parameter:

    bash compile.sh <source> <output_dir>
