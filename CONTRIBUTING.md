## Merge Request Process

1. The header of the MR must be filled out according to the MR template.
2. The header of the MR must contain links to green CI for the latest commit.
3. All discussions are resolved.

    * A discussion is closed by a developer who creates it
  
4. No "thumbs down" and some "thumbs up". The count of "thumbs up" depends
   on changes which bring the MR.
5. Changes in the MR must be covered by tests.
6. If the MR requires manual test runs, the test results have to be provided
   to reviewers through a MR discussion.
7. When the points above are resolved, you may merge the Merge Request, or
   if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer
   to merge it for you.
