# See help here: https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-code-owners

# Rules:
# 1. Each directory should have a minimum of 2 code owners.
# 2. Order is important as the last matching pattern takes the most precedence.
# Keep folders below sorted in folder hierarchy order (alphabetically).
