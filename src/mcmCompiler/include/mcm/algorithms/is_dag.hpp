        // To find a node within a cycle of a directed graph, we perform a
        // search of the graph, looking for back-links; if we find one, it has a
        // cycle, and the current node is part of it.
        //
        // Conceptually, we use three node states: "undiscovered", "discovered",
        // and "finished".
        //
        // Initially, all nodes are undiscovered.  To find a cycle, we
        // repeatedly explore the graph by selecting an undiscovered node and
        // attempting to find a cycle within the subgraph rooted at that node.
        // (Invariant: between explorations, no node is in the "discovered"
        // state.)
        //
        // To find a cycle from a node, we mark our initial node as discovered,
        // and use it to initialize a set of nodes remaining to be checked
        // within the current exploration, and then repeatedly select a node
        // from that set and iterate through its outgoing edges:
        //
        // * Edges to finished nodes are ignored; we know they do not lead to
        //   cycles.
        //
        // * Edges to discovered nodes indicate that we've found a back-link, a
        //   path back to a node previously discovered within the current
        //   depth-first exploration -- so we can return false.
        //
        // * Edges to undiscovered nodes indicate nodes that need to be marked
        //   as "discovered" and added to the current exploration.
        //
        // When the set of nodes to be checked is empty, the exploration is
        // complete, and all of the discovered nodes are marked "finished".
        //
        // When there are no remaining undiscovered nodes, the algorithm has
        // completed without finding a cycle.
        //
        //
        // Implementation notes:
        //
        // * We implement the algorithm iteratively to bound our stack
        //   consumption; recursion here has proven to be problematic when
        //   performing a search on larger graphs.
        //
        // * We maintain our node states externally, keeping the graph itself
        //   constant.
        //
        // * We maintain the set of nodes to be checked as a simple stack,
        //   giving us depth-first exploration semantics.
