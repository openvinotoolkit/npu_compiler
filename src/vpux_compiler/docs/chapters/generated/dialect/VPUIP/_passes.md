### `-assign-physical-barriers`: Assign physical barriers
This pass replaces virtual barriers with physical barriers and assign IDs to them.

#### Options
```
-num-barriers : Number of physical barriers, available for usage
```
### `-barrier-simulation`: Simulate barriers
Simulates the physical barrier execution and stops compilation on fail.
### `-compress-weights`: Compress binary data when possible
This pass applies bitcompactor to tensor binary data. The logic is the following:
1. Find VPUIP::NNDMAOp with Const::DeclareOp source and VPUIP::DeclareTensorOp target.
2. Check that weights size matches minimal compression size.
3. Compress weights.
4. Wrap compressed weights to flat tensor shapes with UInt8 data type.
5. Replace original VPUIP::NNDMAOp with VPUIP::CompressedDMAOp
### `-convert-wtable-op-to-constant`: Convert WeightsTable Operations to IERT.ConstantOp
This pass fills weights table considering the information about the offset in the memory of the weights or activation window.
### `-dump-statistics-of-task-ops`: Dump the statistics of used Task operations
This pass dumps the statistics of used Task operations and makes a report as warning for operations not converted to DPU.
### `-set-compile-params`: Set compilation parameters related to VPUIP Dialect
This pass attaches compilation parameters related to **VPUIP Dialect** to Module attributes and
initializes **IERT Dialect** run-time resources information.

#### Options
```
-vpu-arch          : VPU architecture to compile for
-compilation-mode  : Set compilation mode as reference (ReferenceSW) or hardware (ReferenceHW)
-num-of-dpu-groups : Number of DPU groups
```
