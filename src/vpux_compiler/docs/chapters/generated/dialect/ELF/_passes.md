### `-remove-empty-elf-sections`: Cleans up empty sections in ELF
The pass is part of the ELF pipeline.

Current lowering logic may pre-create sections, without yet knowing if any op will eventually land in it. This
causes some empty sections to be placed in the ELF. This pass should clean them up.
### `-update-ELF-section-flags`: Update ELF section flags
The pass is part of the ELF pipeline.

The pass will update the ELF section flags (secFlags attribute) for each relevant section based on which
processors will access the given section at run time. This information is retrieved from the ops contained
within the section via the ELF_BinaryOpInterface::getAccessingProcs interface method.

A relevant section in the context of this pass is one that requires allocation and/or loading by the loader.
