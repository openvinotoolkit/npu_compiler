### Methods:
#### `waitBarriers`

```c++
mlir::ValueRange waitBarriers();
```
Barriers that will free this task to run#### `waitBarriersMutable`

```c++
mlir::MutableOperandRange waitBarriersMutable();
```
Barriers that will free this task to run#### `updateBarriers`

```c++
mlir::ValueRange updateBarriers();
```
Barriers that will be at least partially unlocked when this task is complete#### `updateBarriersMutable`

```c++
mlir::MutableOperandRange updateBarriersMutable();
```
Barriers that will be at least partially unlocked when this task is complete#### `getBarrierHitsCount`

```c++
std::size_t getBarrierHitsCount();
```
Specifies the value by which barrier counter needs to be incremented taking into consideration the task. All tasks returns 1 except DPUInvariant which hits the barrier as many times as amount of associated DPUVariants
