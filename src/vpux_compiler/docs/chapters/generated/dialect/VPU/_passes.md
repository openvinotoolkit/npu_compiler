### `-adjust-memory-space`: Adjusts the tensor location for VPU-driven operations
The pass adjusts the location of tensors that are used by hardware-driven operations

Currently, it surrounds VPU-driven nodes with Copy operations to specify that all the data
that they consume/produce must reside in CMX
### `-convert-post-ops-to-ppe`: Convert post ops to PPE
### `-init-compiler`: Initializes compiler for VPU platforms
This pass attaches VPU related compilation parameters to Module attributes and
initializes **IERT Dialect** run-time resources information.

#### Options
```
-vpu-arch          : VPU architecture to compile for
-compilation-mode  : Set compilation mode as `ReferenceSW`, `ReferenceHW` or `DefaultHW`
-num-of-dpu-groups : [Optional] Number of available DPU groups
```
### `-multi-cluster-stragegy-assignment`: Determines which multi-cluster strategy is the most optimal for a given layer
Determines which multi-cluster strategy is the most optimal for a given layer
### `-split-NCE-ops-onto-workloads`: Split VPU NCE operation onto workloads
