### `-adjust-memory-space`: Adjusts the tensor location for VPU-driven operations
The pass adjusts the location of tensors that are used by hardware-driven operations

Currently, it surrounds VPU-driven nodes with Copy operations to specify that all the data
that they consume/produce must reside in CMX
### `-cmx-concat`: Move Concat operations from DDR to NNCMX
This pass will try to check if a Concat operation can fit in NNCMX
with few restrictions and if so move the concat from DDR to NNCMX.
### `-init-compiler`: Initializes compiler for VPU platforms
This pass attaches VPU related compilation parameters to Module attributes and
initializes **IERT Dialect** run-time resources information.

#### Options
```
-vpu-arch          : VPU architecture to compile for
-compilation-mode  : Set compilation mode as `ReferenceSW`, `ReferenceHW` or `DefaultHW`
-num-of-dpu-groups : [Optional] Number of available DPU groups
```
### `-manual-strategy-utils`: Utils for reading or writing a json strategy
Utility allowing to store and write as JSON the current selected strategy from the two strategy passes
createMultiClusterStrategyAssignmentPass() and createPrefetchTilingPass(). And also to manually 
overwrite the strategy.

#### Options
```
-write-strategy-to-json       : Flag to enable writing strategy to file
-write-strategy-file-location : Location/path to write strategy file
-read-strategy-from-json      : Flag to enable reading strategy from file
-read-strategy-file-location  : Location/path to read strategy file
```
### `-multi-cluster-strategy-assignment`: This pass compute the hardware efficiency of layer that is executed as SOH or SOK and assigns the most optimal strategy
### `-split-NCE-ops-onto-workloads`: Split VPU NCE operation onto workloads
### `-wrap-vpu-ops-in-ncecluster-tiling`: This pass wraps vpu operations that should be executed across multiple clusters in NCEClusterTiling operations
This pass builds an IR in order to represent multi-cluster compilation. It performs a number of functions.
1) It creates variations of distributed tensors depending on the multi-cluster strategy of the layer. 
2) It creates DMA operations DDR->CMX and wraps the DMAs in NCEClusterTiling.
3) It wraps hardware executable operations in NCEClusterTiling.
