### `-adjust-memory-space`: Adjusts the tensor location for VPU-driven operations
The pass adjusts the location of tensors that are used by hardware-driven operations

Currently, it surrounds VPU-driven nodes with Copy operations to specify that all the data
that they consume/produce must reside in CMX
### `-init-compiler`: Initializes compiler for VPU platforms
This pass attaches VPU related compilation parameters to Module attributes and
initializes **IERT Dialect** run-time resources information.

#### Options
```
-vpu-arch          : VPU architecture to compile for
-compilation-mode  : Set compilation mode as `ReferenceSW`, `ReferenceHW` or `DefaultHW`
-num-of-dpu-groups : [Optional] Number of available DPU groups
```
### `-multi-cluster-strategy-assignment`: This pass compute the hardware efficiency of layer that is executed as SOH or SOK and assigns the most optimal strategy
### `-split-NCE-ops-onto-workloads`: Split VPU NCE operation onto workloads
### `-wrap-vpu-ops-in-ncecluster-tiling`: This pass wraps vpu operations that should be executed across multiple clusters in NCEClusterTiling operations
This pass builds an IR in order to represent multi-cluster compilation. It performs a number of functions.
1) It creates variations of distributed tensors depending on the multi-cluster strategy of the layer. 
2) It creates DMA operations DDR->CMX and wraps the DMAs in NCEClusterTiling.
3) It wraps hardware executable operations in NCEClusterTiling.
