### `-assign-physical-barriers`: Assign physical barriers
This pass replaces virtual barriers with physical barriers and assign IDs to them.

#### Options
```
-num-barriers : Number of physical barriers, available for use
```
### `-assign-virtual-barriers`: Schedules virtual barriers
This pass inserts virtual barriers in the IR such that the number of active barriers at any time
does not exceed the physical number of available barriers 
and that the number of producers to a barrier is less than 256.

#### Options
```
-use-cycle-based-barrier-scheduler : Flag to use cycle based barrier scheduler
-num-barriers                      : Number of physical barriers, available for use
-num-slots-per-barrier             : Number of producer slots per barrier, available for use
```
