### `-break-data-flow`: Breaks data flow in the graph
This pass breaks data flow in the graph. It is required for the VPURT dialect for correct task creation 
because all VPUIP dialect tasks will be inside body of the TaskOp and it is impossible to use operation results inside another body of TaskOp. 
### `-copy-op-hoisting`: Update location of CopyOps in the block
This pass checks all CopyOps and updates their position in the parent block to be close to source op
that generates the copy op source buffer
### `-dma-task-profiling`: DMA task profiling using DMA-Timestamps
This pass add DMA task profiling.
### `-dpu-profiling`: DPU task profiling
This pass allocate required memory for DPU profiling and perform buffer spilling
### `-feasible-allocation`: Feasible Memory Scheduling Pass
Schedule async.execute opeations based on their dependecies and CMX memory availability

#### Options
```
-memory-space              : Memory space to perform allocation
-second-level-memory-space : Second level memory space to perform spilling
```
### `-group-async-execute-ops`: Reduces number of async.execute operations
Groups consecutive operations which utilizes the same executor and max resources into same async.execute region
### `-move-view-ops-into-async-regions`: Moves view-like Operations inside the asynchronous regions which depends on them
### `-move-wait-result-to-async-block-args`: Moves 'async.await' result usage from 'async.execute' body to it's operands
### `-optimize-async-deps`: Optimizes dependencies between 'async.execute' operations
The pass tries to remove extra explicit `!async.token` based dependencies,
if they are represented implicitly (as a result of transitive dependencies).
### `-optimize-copies`: Removes Copy Ops which are unnecessary
This pass checks if Copy Op can be optimized out to reduce the amount of unnecessary DMAs and intermediate buffers.
### `-set-internal-memory-space`: Set specific memory space for all internal memory buffers
This pass updates all Types for internal memory buffers and sets the specified memory space for them.

#### Options
```
-memory-space : Memory space to perform allocation
```
### `-static-allocation`: Replace dynamic allocations with static
This pass replaces all dynamic `alloc`/`dealloc` Operations with `IERT.StaticAlloc`.
It uses simple LinearScan algorithm.

#### Options
```
-memory-space : Memory space to perform allocation
```
### `-wrap-into-async-regions`: Wraps layer operations into asynchronous regions
This pass wraps each IERT layer operation into async region preserving linear execution.
