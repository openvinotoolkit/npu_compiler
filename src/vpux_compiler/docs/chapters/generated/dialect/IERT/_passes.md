### `-cmx-tiling`: Tile Operations to the condition that all their I/O fit into CMX
This pass will replace a set of operations with the pattern OP ==> Subview->Copy->Op->Copy->SubView.
The condition for the replacment is that for each op the SUM of their I/O tensors to fit into CMX memory
### `-copy-op-hoisting`: Update location of CopyOps in the block
This pass checks all CopyOps and updates their position in the parent block to be close to source op
that generates the copy op source buffer
### `-feasible-allocation`: Feasible Memory Scheduling Pass
Schedule async.execute opeations based on their dependecies and CMX memory availability

#### Options
```
-memory-space : Memory space to perform allocation
```
### `-group-async-execute-ops`: Reduces number of async.execute operations
Groups consecutive operations which utilizes the same executor and max resources into same async.execute region
### `-move-view-ops-into-async-regions`: Moves view-like Operations inside the asynchronous regions which depends on them
### `-move-wait-result-to-async-block-args`: Moves 'async.await' result usage from 'async.execute' body to it's operands
### `-optimize-async-deps`: Optimizes dependencies between 'async.execute' operations
The pass tries to remove extra explicit `!async.token` based dependencies,
if they are represented implicitly (as a result of transitive dependencies).
### `-optimize-copies`: Removes Copy Ops which are unnecessary
This pass checks if Copy Op can be optimized out to reduce the amount of unnecessary DMAs and intermediate buffers.
### `-profiling-timestamp`: DMA-Timestamp based network profiling
This pass add dma-timestamp based network profiling.
### `-set-internal-memory-space`: Set specific memory space for all internal memory buffers
This pass updates all Types for internal memory buffers and sets the specified memory space for them.

#### Options
```
-memory-space : Memory space to perform allocation
```
### `-static-allocation`: Replace dynamic allocations with static
This pass replaces all dynamic `alloc`/`dealloc` Operations with `IERT.StaticAlloc`.
It uses simple LinearScan algorithm.

#### Options
```
-memory-space : Memory space to perform allocation
```
### `-wrap-into-async-regions`: Wraps layer operations into asynchronous regions
This pass wraps each IERT layer operation into async region preserving linear execution.
