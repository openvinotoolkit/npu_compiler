### `-add-weights-table-to-eltwise`: Add weights table to EMU.NCEClusterTask op with task type ELTWISE or AVEPOOL.
Eltwise & AVGPool NCEClusterTask ops can parse their mult and shift from weights table in emulator,
unlike in board case. This way, there's no need to update quant params during serialization for their output.
### `-adjust-fq-precision`: Convert the precision of the FQ constants.
Ensure the FQ constants for in/out low/high are of FP16 dtype.
This is needed becaus of emulator restriction of scheduling SW with
different datatypes per input tensors.
### `-remove-weights-alignment`: Adjust weights shape for EMU.NCEClusterTask ops with task type CMCONV and DWCONV.
VPU NCEDepthConvolutionOp and Channel Major NCEConvolutionOp have their weights aligned during
IE to VPU lowering. Emulator cannot compute the ops with aligned weights or infer
the unaligned shape. Therefore, EMU.NCEClusterTask with CMCONV or DWCONV task types will have the weights
alignment removed.
### `-squeeze-bias-shape`: Squeeze shape of the bias tensor.
Reshape the bias tensor into a 1D tensor by only keeping the channel dimension.
Needed due to limitations on firmware side.
