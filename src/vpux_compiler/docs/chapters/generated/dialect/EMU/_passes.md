### `-adjust-fq-precision`: Convert the precision of the FQ constants.
Ensure the FQ constants for in/out low/high are of FP16 dtype.
This is needed becaus of emulator restriction of schedulign SW with
different datatypes per input tensors.
### `-squeeze-bias-shape`: Squeeze shape of the bias tensor.
Reshape the bias tensor into a 1D tensor by taking the 2nd dim.
Needed due to limitations on firmware side.
