### `-adjust-layouts`: Add required layouts to memref
This pass adds the required layouts instead of the default value
depending on the layer specification
### `-cmx-tiling`: Tile Operations to the condition that all their I/O fit into CMX
This pass will replace a set of operations with the pattern OP ==> Subview->Copy->Op->Copy->SubView.
The condition for the replacment is that for each op the SUM of their I/O tensors to fit into CMX memory
### `-move-view-ops-into-async-regions`: Moves view-like Operations inside the asynchronous regions which depends on them
### `-move-wait-result-to-async-block-args`: Moves 'async.await' result usage from 'async.execute' body to it's operands
### `-optimize-async-deps`: Optimizes dependencies between 'async.execute' operations
The pass removes 'async.await' Operations between two consecutive 'async.execute' regions and
establish token-based dependencies between 'async.execute' operations.
### `-set-internal-memory-space`: Set specific memory space for all internal memory buffers
This pass updates all Types for internal memory buffers and sets the specified memory space for them.

#### Options
```
-memory-space : Memory space to perform allocation
```
### `-static-allocation`: Replace dynamic allocations with static
This pass replaces all dynamic `alloc`/`dealloc` Operations with `IERT.StaticAlloc`.
It uses simple LinearScan algorithm.

#### Options
```
-memory-space : Memory space to perform allocation
```
### `-use-user-layout`: Use user layouts for entry point function prototype
This pass updates the CNNNetwork entry point function prototype
and use user-provided layouts for its operands and results.
The pass inserts Reorder operations from/to topology layout.
### `-wrap-into-async-regions`: Wraps layer operations into asynchronous regions
This pass wraps each IERT layer operation into async region preserving linear execution.
