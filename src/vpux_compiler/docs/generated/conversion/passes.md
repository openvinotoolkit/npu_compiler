### `-convert-IE-to-IERT`: Bufferize the IE dialect into the IERT dialect on Function level
This "atomic" pass bufferizes IE Dialect into IERT Dialect.
Only functions inner regions are affected, not signatures.
### `-convert-IERT-to-VPUIP`: Convert IERT Dialect Layer Operations to VPUIP Dialect
This "atomic" pass converts Laye Operations from IERT Dialect to VPUIP Dialect.
It uses simple SW implementation for IERT operations without any optimizations.
### `-lower-IE-to-IERT`: Performs full lowering from the IE Dialect to IERT Dialect
This "pipeline" pass performs full IR lowering from IE Dialect to IERT Dialect,
including Function types, call graph and return operations.
### `-lower-IERT-to-VPUIP`: Performs full lowering from IERT Dialect to VPUIP Dialect
This "pipeline" pass performs full IR lowering from IERT Dialect to VPUIP Dialect,
including Module level Operations.
